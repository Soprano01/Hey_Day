# Hey_Day
### Why is Hey_Day Celebrated?
> At Auburn University, students who had participated in WWII were returning to normalcy as early as 1947, but they felt invisible and unheard while they did so. As a result, the student body at Auburn University and members of the Student Government Association pushed for the creation of Hey Day, a day that would bring the Auburn Family together and foster a friendly environment. On this day, each student had the chance to wear a name tag, fostering a sense of community among all students. Every year, we continue this custom by giving out name tags and enjoining the Auburn Community to say hello to one another, strengthening our bonds as a community. The student body at Auburn University has grown to appreciate and anticipate Hey Day every year, which has become one of the school's oldest and most beloved traditions.
